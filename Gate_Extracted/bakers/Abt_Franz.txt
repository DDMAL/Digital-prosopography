Abt, Franz, German song writer and conductor; b. Eilenburg, Dec. 22, 1819; d. Wiesbaden, March 31, 1885. His father being a clergyman, he was sent to Leipzig Thomasschule to study theology; later obtained an excellent musical education both there and at the Univ. He became a choral conductor in Zurich (1841). In 1852 he was appointed second conductor at the Brunswick Court; in 1855 became first conductor. In 1869 he traveled, as a choral conductor, to Paris, London and Russia; in 1872 he made a highly successful tour in America. He retired on a pension from Brunswick in 1882. Abt wrote over 600 works, comprising more than 3,000 numbers; the largest are the 7 secular cantatas. His popularity as a song writer is due chiefly to the flowing, easy and elegant style of his vocal melodies, some of which (Wenn die Schwalben heimwarts zieh'n, Gute Nacht, du mein herziges Kind, So viele Tausend Blumen, etc.) have become so well known as to be mistaken for genuine folksongs.
