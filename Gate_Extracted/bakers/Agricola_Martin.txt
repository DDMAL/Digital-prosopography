Agricola, Martin, a very important German music theorist and writer; b. Schwiebus (Brandenburg), Jan. 6, 1486; d. Magdeburg, June 10, 1556. His real name was Sore, but he adopted the Latin name Agricola to indicate his peasant origin. Mattheson says that he was the first to abandon the old tablature for modern notation, but this is not quite accurate; Agricola merely proposed an improved system for lute tablature. From 1510 he was a private music teacher in Magdeburg. In 1527 was cantor at the first Lutheran church there. His friend and patron, Rhaw of Wittenberg, published most of Agricola's works, the magnum opus being Musica instrumentalis deudsch (i.e., 'set in German'; 1st ed., Wittenberg, 1529; 4th ed., considerably revised, 1545; modern reprint, Leipzig, 1896). This work, although derived from Virdung's Musica getutscht, contains much new material and is set in couplet verse in the German vernacular. Further works are: Ein kurtz deudsche Musica (1529; 3d ed. as Musica choralis deudsch, 1533); Musica figuralis, with a supplement Von den proportionibus (1532); Scholia in musicam planam Venceslai Philomatis (1538); Rudimenta musices (1539); Quaestiones vulgatiores in musicam (1543); Duo libri musices (posthumous; Wittenberg, 1561; includes reprints of Musica choralis and Musica figuralis; and 54 Instrumentische Gesdnge as a supplement). Compositions: Ein Sangbuchlein aller Sonntags(1541); Neue deutsche geistliche Gesdnge (1544) ; Hymni aliquot sacri (1552) ; Melodiae scholasticae (1557). â€” Cf.
