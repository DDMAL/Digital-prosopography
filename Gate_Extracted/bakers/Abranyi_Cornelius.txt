Abranyi, Cornelius, Hungarian pianist, composer and writer on music; grandfather of Emil Abranyi; b. SzentgyorgyOct. 15, 1822; d. Budapest, Dec. 20, 1903. He came of an ancient Magyar family whose name was originally Eordogh. He was first destined to a legal profession, but in 1834 a meeting with the Hungarian national composer, Erkel, made him decide to study music. In 1843 Abranyi went abroad; in Munich he met Liszt, and became his lifelong friend. He went to Paris and took lessons with Chopin and Kalkbrenner for a short time, returning to Hungary in 1845. He took a leading part in the formation and encouragement of the Hungarian national school of composition during the second half of the nineteenth century. His compositions (130 opus numbers) emphasize the Hungarian national elements; the most ambitious of these works being his Hungarian Millennial Sonata, op. 103. His books (all in Hungarian) include: Art and Revolution (1867); Biography of Franz Liszt and Survey of his Oratorio Christus (1873); General History of Music (1886); History of Hungarian Music in the Nineteenth Century (1900). He also wrote an autobiography, From My Life and Memories (1897).
