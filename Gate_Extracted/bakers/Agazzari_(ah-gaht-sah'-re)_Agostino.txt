Agazzari (ahItalian composer; b. Siena, Dec. 2, 1578; d. there April 10, 1640. He entered the service of Emperor Matthias as a professional musician; proceeding to Rome, he was in turn maestro di cappella at the German College there (1602of St. Apollinaris, and the 'seminario romano'; intimacy with Viadana led to his adoption of the latter's innovations in sacred vocal music (writing church concerti for one or two voices with instrumental harmonic support). From 1630 he was maestro di cappella at Siena Cathedral. His works, variously reprinted in Germany and Holland, were in great favor and very numerous (madrigals, psalms, motets and other church music). His treatise La musica ecclesiastica (Siena, 1638) is a theoretical endeavor to bring the practice of church music into accord with the Resolution of the Council of Trent; he was also among the first to give written instructions for performing the basso continuo, presented in the tract Del sonare sopra il basso con tutti gli strumenti e del loro uso nel concerto (Siena, 1607; in English, O. Strunk, Source Readings in Music History, N. Y., 1950). His pastoral drama, Eumelio (1606) is one of the earliest operas. See A. Adrio's article in 'Die Musik Geschichte und Gegenwart.'
