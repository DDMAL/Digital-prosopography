Afanassiev (ahkovlevitch, Russian composer; b. Tobolsk, 1821; d. St. Petersburg, June 3, 1898. He studied violin with his father, an amateur musician, and joined the orchestra of the Moscow Opera at the age of 17. Later he conducted Italian opera in Moscow and St. Petersburg. He traveled in Europe in 1857. Afanassiev was regarded as the first Russian composer to write a string quartet (1860), but this is refuted by the discovery of 3 string quartets by Aliabiev. He further wrote a cantata, The Feast of Peter the Great, and an opera Ammalatwas produced at the Imperial Opera in St. Petersburg on Dec. 5, 1870, and three more operas, Stenka Razin, Vakula the Smith, and Taras Bulba, which were never performed; also wrote some children's songs.
