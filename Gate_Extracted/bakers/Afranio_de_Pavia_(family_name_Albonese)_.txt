Afranio de Pavia (family name Albonese), Italian theologian, reputed inventor of the bassoon; b. Pavia, 1480; d. Ferrara, c. 1560 as canon of Ferrara. His claim to the invention of the bassoon is based on the attribution to him of the instrument Phagotus, in the book by his nephew Teseo Albonese, Introductio in chaldaicam linguam (Pavia, 1539).
