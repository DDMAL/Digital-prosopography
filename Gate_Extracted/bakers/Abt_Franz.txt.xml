Abt wrote over 600 works, comprising more than 3,000 numbers; the largest are the 7 secular cantatas. His popularity as a song writer is due chiefly to the flowing, easy and elegant style of his vocal melodies, some of which (Wenn die Schwalben heimwarts zieh&apos;n, Gute Nacht, du mein herziges Kind, So viele Tausend Blumen, etc.) have become so well known as to be mistaken for genuine folksongs.
