He entered the service of Emperor Matthias as a professional musician; proceeding to <Location gate:gateId="545" rule1="InLoc1" locType="city" rule2="LocFinal">Rome</Location>, he was in turn maestro di cappella at the German College there (<Date gate:gateId="546" rule1="TempYear3" kind="date" rule2="YearOnlyFinal">1602</Date>of St. Apollinaris, and the &apos;seminario romano&apos;; intimacy with Viadana led to his adoption of the latter&apos;s innovations in sacred vocal music (writing church concerti for one or two voices with instrumental harmonic support). From <Date gate:gateId="547" rule1="TempYear3" kind="date" rule2="YearOnlyFinal">1630</Date> he was maestro di cappella at Siena Cathedral. His works, variously reprinted in <Location gate:gateId="549" rule1="InLoc1" locType="country" rule2="LocFinal">Germany</Location> and <Location gate:gateId="550" rule1="Location1" locType="country" rule2="LocFinal">Holland</Location>, were in great favor and very numerous (madrigals, psalms, motets and other church music).
