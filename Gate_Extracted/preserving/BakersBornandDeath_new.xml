works, comprising more than 3,000 num- 
bers; the largest are the 7 secular cantatas. 
His popularity as a song writer is due 
chiefly to the flowing, easy and elegant 
style of his vocal melodies, some of which 
(Wenn die Schwalben heimwarts zieh&apos;n, 
Gute Nacht, du mein herziges Kind, So 
viele Tausend Blumen, etc.) have become 
so well known as to be mistaken for genuine 
folksongs. See B. Rost, Vom Meister des 
volkstiimlichen deutschen Liedes, Franz Abt 
(Chemnitz, <Date>1924</Date>).

ance in <Location>America</Location> at the Metropolitan Opera 
(<Date>Feb. 22, 1904</Date>). Her performance of 
Salome in Strauss&apos;s opera at Covent Garden 
(<Date>1913</Date>) led to an invitation from Richard 
Strauss to sing the part in <Location>Dresden</Location> and 
<Location>Paris</Location>. Her other roles were Juliette, Ophelie, 
Gilda, Nedda, Elsa, Elisabeth and Sieglinde. 
Her memoirs are published in Finnish, 
Swedish and German. 

Adam (ah-dahn), Adolphe-Charles, cele- 
brated French opera composer; <Event><Birth>b.</Birth> <Location>Paris</Location>, 
<Date>July 24, 1803</Date></Event>; <Event><Death>d.</Death> there, <Date>May 3, 1856</Date></Event>. He 
entered the Paris Cons, in <Date>1817</Date> and studied 
with Boieldieu, whose influence was a de- 
termining factor in his career. His first opera 
was <Location>Pierre</Location> et Catherine (Opera-Comique, 
<Date>Feb. 9, 1829</Date>). The one-act comic opera, 
Le Chalet (Opera-Comique, <Date>Sept. 25, 1834</Date>), 
marked his first success (<Date>1400</Date> performances 
of this opera were given before <Date>1899</Date>). With 
the production of Le Postilion de Long- 
jumeau (Opera-Comique, <Date>Oct. 13, 1836</Date>) 
Adam achieved international fame. Of his 
other operas (he wrote 53 in all), the fol- 
lowing, all produced at the Opera-Comique, 
are the most important: Le Fidele Berger 
(<Date>Jan. 6, 1838</Date>); Le Brasseur de Preston 
(<Date>Oct. 31, 1838</Date>) ; Regine, ou Les Deux Nuits 
(<Date>Jan. 17, 1839</Date>) ; La Reine d&apos;un jour (<Date>Sept. 
19, 1839</Date>); Le Roi d&apos;Yvetot (<Date>Oct. 13, 
1842</Date>); Cagliostro (<Date>Feb. 10, 1844</Date>); Le 
Toreador, ou U Accord parfait (<Date>May 18, 
1849</Date>); Giralda, ou La Nouvelle Psyche 
(<Date>July 20, 1850</Date>); Le Farfadet (<Date>March 19, 
1852</Date>) ; Le Sourd, ou L&apos;Auberge pleine (<Date>Feb. 
2, 1853</Date>). His comic opera Si j&apos;etais roi 
(Theatre-Lyrique, <Date>Sept. 4, 1852</Date>) was also 
very popular; his tragic opera Richard en 
<Location>Palestine</Location> was produced at the Paris Opera 
(<Date>Oct. 7, 1854</Date>) with considerable success, 
but was not retained in the repertoire. Adam 
was also a very successful ballet composer; 
his Giselle, produced at the Paris Opera 
(<Date>June 28, 1841</Date>) became one of the most 
celebrated and enduring choreographic 
scores. His song Cantique de Noel, in numer- 
ous arrangements, enjoyed great popularity. 
In <Date>1847</Date> Adam ventured into the field of 
management with an operatic enterprise, 
the Theatre National; the revolutionary 
outbreak of <Date>1848</Date>, however, brought financial 
ruin to his undertaking. In <Date>1849</Date> he was 
appointed prof, of composition at the Paris 
Cons. He traveled widely in <Location>Europe</Location>, visiting 
<Location>London</Location>, <Location>Berlin</Location> and <Location>St. Petersburg</Location>. As one 
of the creators of French comic opera, Adam 
ranks with Boieldieu and Auber in the ex- 
pressiveness of his melodic material if not in 
originality or inventive power. Adam&apos;s mem- 



oirs were published posthumously in 2 
volumes under the titles Souvenirs d&apos;un 
musicien (<Date>1857</Date>), and Dernier s souvenirs 
d&apos;un musicien (<Date>1859</Date>). A. Pougin wrote his 
biography (<Location>Paris</Location>, <Date>1877</Date>).

phonic works of his survive. His rondeaux, 
etc., are reprinted by Fr. Gennrich, in Ron- 
deaux, Virelais und Balladen (I, <Date>1921</Date>). â€”

of St. Apollinaris, and the &apos;seminario ro- 
mano&apos;; intimacy with Viadana led to his 
adoption of the latter&apos;s innovations in sacred 
vocal music (writing church concerti for one 
or two voices with instrumental harmonic 
support). From <Date>1630</Date> he was maestro di 
cappella at Siena Cathedral. His works, 
variously reprinted in <Location>Germany</Location> and <Location>Holland</Location>, 
were in great favor and very numerous 
(madrigals, psalms, motets and other church

(Siena, <Date>1638</Date>) is a theoretical endeavor to 
bring the practice of church music into 
accord with the Resolution of the Council 
of Trent; he was also among the first to 
give written instructions for performing the 
basso continuo, presented in the tract Del 
sonare sopra il basso con tutti gli strumenti

Jakob Stainer. Violins of his are extant dat- 
ing from as early as the end of <Date>1644</Date>. His 
best examples date from <Date>1680</Date> onward. Ow-

Michele (<Date>1677-1730</Date>) at <Location>Graz</Location>. Other violin 
makers named Albani, or at least using the 
name on their instruments (perhaps for its

Cambo-Bains (<Location>Pyrenees</Location>), <Date>May 18, 1909</Date></Event>. He 
exhibited precocious musical ability. When 
he was six, his mother took him to <Location>Paris</Location>, 
where he had a few private lessons with 
Marmontel. Upon his return to <Location>Spain</Location>, he 
gave concerts with his sister Clementine, 
also a child prodigy. In <Date>1868</Date> the family 
moved to <Location>Madrid</Location>, and Albeniz entered the 
Conservatory there. Possessed by a spirit of 
adventure, he ran away from home at the 
age of 13, and traveled in <Location>Spain</Location>, giving 
concerts. He then stowed away on a ship 
for <Location>Puerto Rico</Location>; from there he went to 
<Location>Cuba</Location> and to the <Location>U.S.</Location>, supporting himself 
by playing concerts in private and in public. 
He returned to <Location>Spain</Location> in <Date>June, 1875</Date>, and 
was befriended in <Location>Madrid</Location> by Count Guil- 
lermo Morphy, who enabled him to under- 
take serious study, first at the Brussels Cons, 
with Brassin (piano) and Dupont and 
Gevaert (composition) ; and then at the 
Leipzig Cons, with Jadassohn and Reinecke. 
He went to <Location>Budapest</Location> in <Date>1878</Date> to meet Liszt, 
but it is doubtful that he actually became 
Liszt&apos;s pupil. Albeniz married Rosita Jor- 
dana in <Date>1883</Date>; their daughter, Laura Albeniz, 
became a well known painter. In <Date>1893</Date> he 
settled in <Location>Paris</Location>; he also gave frequent piano 
recitals in <Location>Spain</Location>, and visited <Location>London</Location>. His 
early works were for the theater; he wrote 
several operas: The Magic Opal (<Location>London</Location>, 
<Date>Jan 19, 1893</Date>); Enrico Clifford (<Location>Barcelona</Location>, 
<Date>May 8, 1895</Date>); <Location>San Antonio</Location> de la <Location>Florida</Location> 
(<Location>Madrid</Location>, <Date>Oct. 26, 1894</Date>; also staged in 
<Location>Brussels</Location>, <Date>Jan. 3, 1905</Date> under the title Er- 
mitage fleuri): Pepita JimSnez (<Location>Barcelona</Location>, 
<Date>Jan. 5, 1896</Date>). He undertook the composi- 
tion of an operatic trilogy King Arthur, of 
which only the first part, Merlin, was com- 
pleted. In the meantime he met Felipe

Pedrell, and was greatly influenced by 
Pedrell&apos;s passionate championship of national 
Spanish music. Albeniz&apos;s first nationalistically 
inspired composition was the rhapsody Catal- 
onia for piano and orch. (<Date>1899</Date>). In <Date>1906-09</Date> 
he wrote his most remarkable national work 
Iberia, a set of 12 piano pieces: Evocacidn, 
El <Location>Puerto</Location>, Fete-Dieu a <Location>Seville</Location>, Rondena, Al- 
meria, Triana, El Albaicin, El Polo, Lava- 
pies, <Location>Malaga</Location>, Jerez, Eritana. In this suite, 
which is a brilliant example of virtuoso writ- 
ing for the instrument, Albeniz applied the 
impressionistic technique as developed by De- 
bussy. He left unfinished two other piano 
works, Azulejos (completed by Granados) 
and <Location>Navarra</Location> (completed by D. de Severac; 
orchestrated by Fernandez Arbos). Arbos 
also made effective orchestral transcriptions 
of Evocacidn, Triana, and Fete-Dieu a 
<Location>Seville</Location> (also orchestrated by Stokowski). 
Among Albeniz&apos;s smaller piano pieces, the 
Seguidillas, <Location>Cordova</Location>, and the Tango in D 
have attained wide popularity. Bibl. : J. de

music. At the age of 12 he entered the 
National Training School in <Location>London</Location>, where 
he studied piano with Pauer and theory 
with Stainer, Prout and Sir Arthur Sullivan. 
He made extraordinary progress both as 
pianist and composer, and after several ap- 
pearances at the Popular Concerts, was the 
soloist in Schumann&apos;s concerto at the Crystal 
Palace, <Location>London</Location> (<Date>Feb. 5, 1881</Date>). On <Date>Oct. 24, 
1881</Date>, when only 17, he played his own 
piano concerto at one of Hans Richter&apos;s 
concerts, arousing great enthusiasm; the 
press compared him to Mozart and Mendels- 
sohn. He received a Mendelssohn fellow- 
ship, and went to <Location>Vienna</Location>; later he studied 
with Liszt, who was greatly impressed by his 
technique and often referred to him as &apos;the 
young Tausig.&apos; In <Date>1895</Date>, d&apos;Albert was ap- 
pointed conductor at <Location>Weimar</Location>; in <Date>1907</Date>, be- 
came director of the High School for Music 
in <Location>Berlin</Location>. In the wake of his success, he 
repudiated his English birth, adopting Ger- 
man citizenship, and made repeated state- 
ments derogatory to English culture and 
even to his former English teachers. He was 
vocal in his enmity to <Location>England</Location> during the 
first World War, which led in turn to an 
understandable repugnance among British 
musicians to accept his music. D&apos;Albert com- 
posed industriously. He published two piano 
concertos (in B minor and E) ; a cello con- 
certo in C; 2 overtures (Hyperion and Es- 
ther); a symphony in F; an orchestral suite 
in 5 movements (<Date>1924</Date>); a piano sonata, a 
piano suite in 5 movements; 2 string quar- 
tets; Der Mensch und das Leben for 6-part 
chorus and orch. (op. 14) ; 4 piano pieces, 
op. 16 (Waltz, Scherzo, Intermezzo, Bal- 
lade), minor piano pieces and songs. 
However, his main interest was in the field 
of opera. Of his 20 operas, the most success- 
ful were: Tie f land, first staged at the 
German opera in <Location>Prague</Location> (<Date>Nov. 15, 1903</Date>), 
and Die toten Augen (<Location>Dresden</Location>, <Date>March 5, 
1916</Date>). The list of his other operas includes: 
Der Rubin (Karlsruhe, <Date>Oct. 12, 1893</Date>); 
Ghismonda (<Location>Dresden</Location>, <Date>Nov. 28, 1895</Date>) ; Ger- 
not (Mannheim, <Date>April 11, 1897</Date>); Die 
Abreise (<Location>Frankfurt</Location>, <Date>Oct. 20, 1898</Date>); Kain 
(<Location>Berlin</Location>, <Date>Feb. 17, 1900</Date>) ; Der Improvisator 
(<Location>Berlin</Location>, <Date>Feb. 20, 1902</Date>) ; Flauto solo (<Location>Prague</Location>, 
<Date>Nov. 12</Date>,. <Date>1905</Date>); Tragaldabas (or Der ge- 
borgte Ehemann; <Location>Hamburg</Location>, <Date>Dec. 3, 1907</Date>);

finished; completed by Leo Blcch; <Location>Dresden</Location>, 
<Date>Sept. 29, 1932</Date>). Despite a brilliant begin- 
ning, <Location>Eugene</Location> d&apos;Albert did not justify his 
early promise, and his operas and other 
works are rarely revived. His musical idiom 
oscillates between the Italian melodic style 
and German contrapuntal writing, and fails 
to achieve originality. <Location>Eugene</Location> d&apos;Albert&apos;s per- 
sonal life was a stormy one. He was married 
six times; his first wife was Teresa Carreno 
(<Date>1892-95</Date>); his second was the singer, 
Hermine Finck. â€” Cf. W. Raupp, Eugen

support to musical activities in <Location>England</Location>, 
sponsoring orchestras and choral societies. 
He studied organ and theory, and acquired 
an estimable technique of composition; 
wrote Invocazione alia armonia for chorus 
and orch. His songs were published in <Date>1881</Date> 
under the title The Collected Compositions 
of his Royal Highness the Prince Consort. 
They reveal a romantic musical temper, 
influenced by Mendelssohn.

siderable renown as singer and harpsichord 
player; wrote 3 operas, Endimione, Galatea, 
and Olimpiade. In <Date>1737</Date> he was a member 
of the Venetian Embassy in <Location>Rome</Location>, and 
made several appearances there as singer 
and player. His fame in music history rests 
on his reputed invention of the arpeggio 
style of keyboard accompaniment, which be- 
came known as the &apos;Alberti Bass&apos;. His set 
of 8 sonatas, published by Walsh in <Location>London</Location>, 
gives many illustrations of this device.

<Date>Jan. 17, 1750</Date></Event>. <Date>Between 1694 and 1740</Date> he 
produced 45 operas, most of them in <Location>Venice</Location>. 
He rarely absented himself from <Location>Venice</Location>, but 
it is known that he attended the premiere 
of his opera Griselda in <Location>Florence</Location> (<Date>1703</Date>); 
in <Date>1722</Date> he was in <Location>Munich</Location> where he pre- 
sented his festive opera / veri amici. It is, 
however, as a composer of instrumental 
music that he is significant; Bach, his close 
contemporary, admired Albinoni&apos;s music; 
made arrangements of two fugues from Al- 
binoni&apos;s trio-sonatas (Bach Gesellschaft, Nos. 
437, 438). The following works are avail- 
able in modern editions: violin concerto 
(ed. by Vieweg) ; 2 violin sonatas and a 
trio-sonata (ed. by Nagel) ; organ transcrip- 
tions of 2 violin concertos (ed. by Walther) ; 
flute sonata (ed. by Schaffler) ; 3 oboe con- 
certos (ed. by B. Paumgartner, <Location>London</Location>, 
<Date>1948</Date>). A detailed catalogue of Albinoni&apos;s 
works and a thematic analysis are given by

ogna with Monbelli; in <Date>1841</Date> was introduced 
to Rossini who agreed to give her lessons. 
She made her debut in <Location>Bologna</Location>, in Pacini&apos;s 
opera Saffo (<Date>Oct. 3, 1842</Date>); shortly after- 
wards, sang at La Scala in Rossini&apos;s Assedio 
di Corinto (<Date>Dec. 30, 1842</Date>). She then sang 
in <Location>Russia</Location>, and obtained great success during 
the season of <Date>1844-45</Date> in <Location>St. Petersburg</Location>, 
appearing at the Italian opera with Tam- 
burini, Rubini and Mme. Viardot. After ap- 
pearances in <Location>Prague</Location>, <Location>Berlin</Location> and Hamburg, 
she appeared in the spring of <Date>1847</Date> in <Location>Rome</Location> 
and at Covent Garden where she became 
a rival of Jenny Lind with the public. So 
successful were her <Location>London</Location> appearances 
that her fees were increased to 2,000 pounds 
a season. She gave four &apos;concerts-spectacles&apos; 
in <Location>Paris</Location> in <Date>Oct., 1847</Date>: made her <Location>Paris</Location> opera 
debut in Rossini&apos;s Semiramide (<Date>Dec. 2,

other cities. On <Date>July 21, 1853</Date>, Alboni mar- 
ried Count Pepoli (<Event><Death>d.</Death> <Date>Oct. 10, 1867</Date></Event>); on 
<Date>Jan. 22, 1877</Date> she married Charles Zieger, 
a French officer, and settled in <Location>France</Location>. Suf- 
fering from excessive obesity, she gradually 
retired from the stage, but continued to ap- 
pear occasionally in concert, singing while 
sitting in a large chair. Her vocal range 
was exceptional, from the contralto G to 
high soprano C, enabling her to sing soprano 
parts. She bequeathed a large sum of money 
to the <Location>City</Location> of <Location>Paris</Location>. In appreciation, the 
City Council, on <Date>Oct. 15, 1895</Date>, named a 
street in Passy after her. Arthur Pougin&apos;s 
monograph Marietta Alboni (<Location>Paris</Location>, <Date>1912</Date>)

and presents a documented outline of her 
career.

ALFANO â€” ALFIERI 



Alfano, Franco, eminent Italian composer; 
<Event><Birth>b.</Birth> Posilippo (<Location>Naples</Location>), <Date>March 8, 1876</Date></Event>; <Event><Death>d.</Death> 
San Remo, <Date>Oct. 26, 1954</Date></Event>. He studied com- 
position with Paolo Serrao in <Location>Naples</Location>, and 
with Jadassohn and Hans Sitt in <Location>Leipzig</Location>. 
From the beginning of his musical career, 
Alfano was interested in opera. His first 
stage work Miranda was produced in Leip- 
zig when he was barely 20; another opera, 
La Fonte di Enscir, followed (Breslau, <Date>Nov. 
8, 1898</Date>). In <Date>1900</Date> he went to <Location>Paris</Location> and 
became fascinated by light theater music. 
While in <Location>Paris</Location> he wrote a folk ballet <Location>Napoli</Location> 
which was staged at Folies-Bergeres (<Date>Jan. 
28, 1901</Date>), proving so successful that it ran 
for 160 successive performances. Returning 
to <Location>Italy</Location>, he began work on an opera after 
Tolstoy&apos;s novel Resurrection. It was pro- 
duced as Risurrezione, in <Location>Turin</Location> (<Date>Nov. 4, 
1904</Date>) with sensational acclaim; the Amer- 
ican premiere (<Location>Chicago</Location>, <Date>Dec. 31, 1925</Date>) 
was equally successful; there were also nu- 
merous performances in <Location>Germany</Location> and 
<Location>France</Location>. The opera was widely praised for 
its dramatic power and melodic richness in 
the best tradition of realistic Italian opera. 
Alfano continued to compose industriously 
for another half-century, but his later operas 
failed to equal the success of Risurrezione. 
They are: 77 Principe Zilah (<Location>Genoa</Location>, <Date>Feb. 
3, 1909</Date>) ; L&apos;ombra di Don Giovanni (La 
Scala, <Location>Milan</Location>, <Date>April 3, 1914</Date>) ; La Leggenda 
di Sakuntala (<Location>Bologna</Location>, <Date>Dec. 10, 1921</Date>) 
Madonna Imperia, lyric comedy (<Location>Turin</Location> 
<Date>May 5, 1927</Date>; Met. Opera, N. Y., <Date>Feb. 8 
1928</Date>); L&apos;Ultimo Lord (<Location>Naples</Location>, <Date>April 19 
1930</Date>) ; Cyrano de <Location>Bergerac</Location> (<Location>Rome</Location>, <Date>Jan. 22 
1936</Date>) ; II Dottor Antonio (<Location>Rome</Location>, <Date>April 30 
1949</Date>). Alfano also wrote 3 symphonies 
(<Date>1909</Date>; <Date>1932</Date>; <Date>1934</Date>); 3 string quartets, a 
violin sonata, a cello sonata, and a ballet 
Vesuvius (<Date>1938</Date>; a symphonic poem was 
drawn from it in <Date>1946</Date>). One of Alfano&apos;s 
signal achievements was that he completed 
Puccini&apos;s last opera, Turandot, adding the 
last scene. His Hymn to Bolivar, for chorus 
and orch., written for the centennial of 
Bolivar&apos;s death, was performed in <Location>Caracas</Location>, 
<Location>Venezuela</Location>, on <Date>Dec. 22, 1930</Date>. He was also 
active in the field of musical education; 
was successively director of the &apos;Liceo mu- 
sicale&apos; in <Location>Bologna</Location> (<Date>1919-23</Date>); of the Turin 
Cons. (<Date>1923-39</Date>); superintendent of the 
Teatro Massimo in <Location>Palermo</Location> (<Date>1940-42</Date>), and 
from <Date>1947</Date>, director of the Rossini Cons, in 
Pesaro. â€” Bibl.: G. M. Gatti, Franco Alfano

ALkAN â€” ALLEN 



wrote 3 operas: Mitridate (<Date>1738</Date>), Ifigenia 
(<Date>1739</Date>), Semiramide (<Date>1740</Date>); a divertimento 
Apollo tra le Muse in Parnasso (<Date>1737</Date>), and 
a Stabat Mater (<Date>1749</Date>). 

Alkan (ahl-kahn) (real name Morhange); 
Charles-Henri Valentin, French pianist and 
composer of Jewish extraction; <Event><Birth>b.</Birth> <Location>Paris</Location>, 
<Date>Nov. 30, 1813</Date></Event>; <Event><Death>d.</Death> there, <Date>March 29, 1888</Date></Event>. 
His three brothers were also musicians; his 
father was the founder of a school for 
Jewish children. Alkan&apos;s talent was pre- 
cocious; he was accepted at the Paris Cons, 
at the age of six and studied piano with 
Zimmermann. In <Date>1833</Date> he visited <Location>London</Location>, 
then returned to <Location>Paris</Location>, where his main acti- 
vities were playing concerts in the fashion- 
able salons and teaching piano. He entered 
the brilliant circle of musicians and littera- 
teurs, among whom were Chopin, George 
Sand, Hugo and Liszt. He <Death>died</Death> as a result 
of injuries sustained when a heavy bookcase 
fell on him as he tried to reach for a book. 
Like Chopin, Alkan wrote almost exclusively 
for piano; the list of his works includes 76 
opus numbers, in addition to many pieces 
not numbered by opus. His pieces are pro- 
grammatic, bearing such titles as Desk; a 
set of variations, Les Omnibus; Le vent (op. 
15) ; Le Tambour bat aux Champs (op. 50) ; 
he was the first composer to write a piece de- 
scriptive of the railroad {Le Chemin de fer, 
op. 27). His 2 sets of etudes, in all major and 
minor keys (op. 35 and 39), of transcendent 
difficulty, present great interest as examples 
of modern piano technique. Other works 
are 3 Etudes de bravoure (op. 16) ; Le 
preux, etude de concert (op. 17); 3 pieces 
poetiques (op. 18); Bourree d&apos;<Location>Auvergne</Location> (op. 
29); a sonata (op. 33, subtitled Les quatre 
ages); Les mois (op. 8, 74), comprising 12 
pieces, etc. He also wrote 2 piano con- 
certos, a piano trio, a cello sonata and vocal 
music. Cesar Franck arranged several of 
his pieces for organ. For a long time Alkan&apos;s 
music was completely forgotten, but his sig- 
nificance as an inventive composer became 
more evident in the 20th century. Chapters 
dealing with Alkan are found in Sorabji&apos;s 
book Around Music (<Location>London</Location>, <Date>1932</Date>), and in 
Bernard van Dieren&apos;s Down Among the 
Dead Men (<Location>London</Location>, <Date>1935</Date>).

Mottetti are extant (a soprano solo with 
violins, a tenor duet and a bass solo, each 
accompanied by 2 violins).

He was a choir boy in <Location>Rome</Location> from <Date>1591-96</Date>; 
then studied with Giovanni Maria Nanino 
(<Date>1600-07</Date>). He entered the Papal Chapel in 
<Date>1629</Date>, after serving for some years as choris- 
ter and composer for the cathedral at Fermo. 
He is chiefly known as the composer of the 
celebrated Miserere in 9 parts (i.e., for two 
choirs singing 4 and 5 parts respectively), 
regularly sung during <Date>Holy Week</Date> at the 
Sistine Chapel, and surreptitiously written 
out by Mozart after hearing it twice, though 
its publication was forbidden on pain of 
excommunication; since then it has been 
frequently published. Many other works by 
Allegri are preserved in MS.; 2 books of 
Concertini and 2 of Mottetti have been 
printed, also a 4-part sonata for strings 
which might be regarded as the prototype 
of the string quartet. See A. Cametti, La 
scuola dei pueri cantus di S. Luigi dei 
Francesi in <Location>Roma</Location>, in &apos;Rivista Musicale

Offenbach, <Date>March 28, 1741</Date></Event>; <Event><Death>d.</Death> there, <Date>June

his name and had publ. 1,200 compositions 
by the time of his death. For seven years 
(<Date>1777-84</Date>) he was Kapellmeister at Dobble- 
lin&apos;s Theater in <Location>Berlin</Location>. He was a prolific 
composer, author of 19 Singspiele and 14

and Der Liebhaber als Automat (<Location>Berlin</Location>, 
<Date>Sept. 11, 1782</Date>). Bretzner wrote the libretto 
of Die Entfiihrung aus dem Serail, or Bel- 
mont und Constanze for him; the opera was 
produced in <Location>Berlin</Location>, <Date>May 25, 1781</Date>. The 
same text was used the following year by 
Mozart for his celebrated work, which 
elicited Bretzner&apos;s haughty protest against 
&quot;a certain man named Mozart&quot; for the un- 
authorized use of his libretto. Among 
Andre&apos;s songs, the Rheinweinlied (&apos;Bekranzt 
mit Laub&apos;) was widely performed. Andre is

he studied with Vollweiler in Mannheim 
(<Date>1793-96</Date>); was a fine pianist, violinist and 
composer before entering the Univ. of Jena; 
after completing his studies he made exten- 
sive travels, and on his father&apos;s death took 
charge of the business, adding particular 
lustre to its good name by the purchase 
( 1 800 ) of Mozart&apos;s entire musical remains. 
He publ. Mozart&apos;s autograph thematic cat- 
alogue, and supplemented it by a list of the 
works so acquired. By accepting the appli- 
cation of the lithographic process to music- 
engraving (<Date>1779</Date>), he took another long 
stride towards placing his firm in the front 
rank. He was also a composer (2 operas, 
symphonies, songs, etc. ) , a successful teacher, 
and a noteworthy theorist. He wrote 2 vols, 
on harmony, counterpoint, canon and fugue, 
(<Date>1832-43</Date>; new revised ed. <Date>1875</Date>); and An-
