<Person>Adam</Person> (ah-dahn), Adolphe-<Person>Charles</Person>, cele- 
brated French opera composer; <Event>b. Paris, 
July 24, 1803</Event>; <Event>d. there, May 3, 1856</Event>. He 
entered the Paris Cons, in 1817 and studied 
with Boieldieu, whose influence was a de- 
termining factor in his career. His first opera 
was Pierre et <Person>Catherine</Person> (Opera-Comique, 
Feb. 9, 1829). The one-act comic opera, 
<Person>Le</Person> Chalet (Opera-Comique, Sept. 25, 1834), 
marked his first success (1400 performances 
of this opera were given before 1899). With 
the production of <Person>Le</Person> Postilion de Long- 
jumeau (Opera-Comique, Oct. 13, 1836) 
<Person>Adam</Person> achieved international fame. Of his 
other operas (he wrote 53 in all), the fol- 
lowing, all produced at the Opera-Comique, 
are the most important: <Person>Le</Person> Fidele Berger 
(Jan. 6, 1838); <Person>Le</Person> Brasseur de <Person>Preston</Person> 
(Oct. 31, 1838) ; <Person>Regine</Person>, ou Les Deux Nuits 
(Jan. 17, 1839) ; La <Person>Reine</Person> d un jour (Sept. 
19, 1839); <Person>Le</Person> <Person>Roi</Person> d Yvetot (Oct. 13,

2, 1853). His comic opera Si j etais roi 
(Theatre-Lyrique, Sept. 4, 1852) was also 
very popular; his tragic opera <Person>Richard</Person> en 
Palestine was produced at the Paris Opera 
(Oct. 7, 1854) with considerable success, 
but was not retained in the repertoire. <Person>Adam</Person> 
was also a very successful ballet composer; 
his <Person>Giselle</Person>, produced at the Paris Opera 
(June 28, 1841) became one of the most 
celebrated and enduring choreographic 
scores. His song Cantique de <Person>Noel</Person>, in numer- 
ous arrangements, enjoyed great popularity. 
In 1847 <Person>Adam</Person> ventured into the field of 
management with an operatic enterprise, 
the Theatre National; the revolutionary 
outbreak of 1848, however, brought financial 
ruin to his undertaking. In 1849 he was 
appointed prof, of composition at the Paris 
Cons. He traveled widely in Europe, visiting 
London, Berlin and St. Petersburg. As one 
of the creators of French comic opera, <Person>Adam</Person> 
ranks with Boieldieu and Auber in the ex- 
pressiveness of his melodic material if not in 
originality or inventive power. <Person>Adam</Person> s mem- 



oirs were published posthumously in 2 
volumes under the titles Souvenirs d un 
musicien (1857), and Dernier s souvenirs 
d un musicien (1859). <Person>A. Pougin</Person> wrote his

conducted Italian opera in Moscow and 
St. Petersburg. He traveled in Europe in 
1857. Afanassiev was regarded as the first 
Russian composer to write a string quartet 
(1860), but this is refuted by the discovery 
of 3 string quartets by <Person>Aliabiev</Person>. He further 



wrote a cantata, The Feast of <Person>Peter</Person> the 
Great, and an opera Ammalat-Bek, which 
was produced at the Imperial Opera in St.

Italian theologian, reputed inventor of the 
bassoon; <Event>b. Pavia, 1480</Event>; <Event>d. Ferrara, c. 1560</Event> 
as canon of Ferrara. His claim to the inven- 
tion of the bassoon is based on the attribu- 
tion to him of the instrument Phagotus, in 
the book by his nephew Teseo Albonese, 
Introductio in chaldaicam linguam (Pavia, 
1539). 

Agazzari (ah-gaht-sah -re), Agostino,

sional musician; proceeding to Rome, he 
was in turn maestro di cappella at the 
German College there (1602-06), the church 
of St. Apollinaris, and the  seminario ro- 
mano ; intimacy with Viadana led to his 
adoption of the latter s innovations in sacred 
vocal music (writing church concerti for one 
or two voices with instrumental harmonic 
support). From 1630 he was maestro di 
cappella at Siena Cathedral. His works, 
variously reprinted in Germany and Holland, 
were in great favor and very numerous 
(madrigals, psalms, motets and other church 
music). His treatise La musica ecclesiastica 
(Siena, 1638) is a theoretical endeavor to 
bring the practice of church music into 
accord with the Resolution of the Council 
of Trent; he was also among the first to 
give written instructions for performing the 
basso continuo, presented in the tract <Person>Del</Person> 
sonare sopra il basso con tutti gli strumenti 
e del loro uso nel concerto (Siena, 1607; 
in <Person>English, O.</Person> <Person>Strunk</Person>, Source Readings in 
Music History, N. Y., 1950). His pastoral 
drama, Eumelio (1606) is one of the earliest 
operas. See <Person>A. Adrio</Person> s article in  Die Musik

cola to indicate his peasant origin. Matthe- 
son says that he was the first to abandon 
the old tablature for modern notation, but 
this is not quite accurate; <Person>Agricola</Person> merely 
proposed an improved system for lute tabla- 
ture. From 1510 he was a private music

dones (Venice, 1590; Augsburg, 1595; Nur- 
emberg, 1597); Tricinia <Person>Mariana</Person> (Inns- 
bruck, 1598) ; Divinae laudes (Augsburg, 
1602) etc. His Cantiones ecclesiasticae cum 
basso generali et continuo (Dillingen, 1607) 
are noteworthy as one of the earliest works 
in which the term  basso continuo  appears 
in the title. A selection of Aichinger s works 
is included in vol. X of  Denkmaler der 
Tonkunst in Bayern,  prefaced with a bio- 
graphical article by the editor, Th. Kroyer.

Alaleona, Domenico, Italian theorist and 
composer; <Event>b. Montegiorgio, Nov. 16, 1881</Event>; 



<Event>d. there, Dec. 28, 1928</Event>. He studied organ 
and clarinet in his native town; in 1901 
went to Rome where he studied piano with 
Sgambati, organ with Renzi and theory with 
De Sanctis at Santa <Person>Cecilia</Person>; was then active 
as choral conductor in Leghorn and Rome; 
in 1911 obtained the post of prof, of musical 
esthetics at Santa <Person>Cecilia</Person>. He wrote an opera

vived) ; a Requiem; Sinfonia italiana; 12 
Canzoni italiane and 4 Laudi italiane for 
various instrumental groups; a cycle of 18 
songs <Person>Melodie Pascoliane</Person> and other works. 
However, his importance lies in his theoret- 
ical writings. His valuable book Studii sulla 
storia dell  oratorio musicale in Italia 
(Turin, 1908) was reprinted in Milan 
(1945) as Storia dell  oratorio musicale in 
Italia, and is now a standard work. A be- 
liever in musical progress, he contributed 
several original ideas to the theory of modern 
music, notably in his article <Person>L</Person> armonia 
modernissima ( Rivista Musicale,  1911), and 
originated the term  dodecafonia.  He also 
contributed articles on Italian composers to 
<Person>Eaglefield-</Person>HulFs Dictionary of Modern 
Music and Musicians (London, 1924). The 
entry on Alaleona in that dictionary contains 
a complete list of his works and bibliography. 

Alard (ah-lar ), <Person>Jean-Delphin</Person>, a distin- 
guished violinist of the French school; <Event>b. 
Bayonne, March 8, 1815</Event>; <Event>d. Paris, Feb. 22, 
1888</Event>. A pupil of Habeneck at Paris Cons.

succeeded Baillot as prof, in 1843, and as 
leader of the royal orchestra, teaching in the 
Cons, till 1875. A fine instructor (Sarasate 
was his pupil), he publ. a Violin School of 
high merit, a selection from 18th-century 
classics (Les maitres classiques du violon), 
and numerous brilliant and popular pieces 
for violin (concertos, etudes, fantasias, etc.). 

Alary, <Person>Jules</Person> (Giulio) Eugene Abraham, 

Italian-French composer; <Event>b. Mantua, March 
16, 1814</Event>; <Event>d. Paris, April 17, 1891</Event>. He 
studied at the Cons, of Milan; then played 
the flute at La Scala. In 1838 he settled in 
Paris as a successful voice teacher and com- 
poser. He wrote numerous operas, among 
them Rosamunda (Florence, June 10, 
1840) ; <Person>Le</Person> tre nozze (Paris, March 29, 1851; 
a polka-duet from it, sung by <Person>Henrietta 
Sontag</Person> and Lablache, was highly popular), 
and Sardanapalo (St. Petersburg, Feb. 16, 
1852). His opera La voix humaine had the 
curious distinction of being staged at the 
Paris Opera (Dec. 30, 1861) with the sole 
purpose of making use of the scenery left 
over after the fiasco of Tannhauser (the ac-

burg, as in Tannhauser). It held the stage 
for 13 performances (Tannhauser had 
three). Alary also wrote a mystery play 
Redemption (Paris, April 14, 1850), much 
sacred music and some chamber works. 

Alayrac, d.  See Dalayrac. 

Albanese, <Person>Licia</Person>, Italian-American soprano; 
<Event>b. Bari, July 22, 1913</Event>. She studied with 
<Person>Giuseppina Baldassare-</Person>Tedeschi; made her 
opera debut at Parma in Madama Butterfly 
(Dec. 10, 1935) ; sang the same role in her 
first appearance with the Metropolitan 
Opera (Feb. 9, 1940). She lived in Italy 
during World War II; returning to America 
in 1945, she sang with Toscanini and the 
NBC Symphony; also continued to appear 
with the Metropolitan Opera. 

<Person>Albani</Person> (ahl-bah -ne), <Person>Emma</Person>, (stage name 
of <Person>Marie Louise Cecilia Emma Lajeunesse</Person>) 
Canadian dramatic soprano; <Event>b. Chambly, 
near Montreal, Nov. 1, 1847</Event>; <Event>d. London, 
April 3, 1930</Event>. She sang in a Catholic church 
in Albany, N. Y. in 1864; was then sent to 
Europe for study, first with Duprez in Paris, 
and then with Lamperti in Milan (Lamperti 
dedicated to her his treatise on the trill). 
She made her debut as <Person>Amina</Person> in La Son- 
nambula in Messina in 1870, under the 
name of <Person>Albani</Person>, in honor of the American 
city that gave her the first start. After 
further appearances in Italy, she made her 
London debut, again as <Person>Amina</Person> (Covent 
Garden, April 2, 1872). In 1873 she sang 
in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Her Amer- 
ican operatic debut was in the same role 
at the New York Academy of Music, in 
<Person>Max Strakosch</Person> s company (Oct. 21, 1874). 
It paved the way for later successes with 
the Metropolitan Opera, where she made 
her first appearance as <Person>Gilda</Person> (Dec. 23, 
1891). Her last important operatic engage- 
ment was as <Person>Isolde</Person> at Covent Garden (June 
26, 1896). She sang in concerts, however, 
for several years longer. Her repertoire in- 
cluded <Person>Marguerite</Person>, Mignon, <Person>Ophelia</Person>, <Person>Elsa</Person>, 
<Person>Elisabeth</Person>, <Person>Lucia</Person> and <Person>Desdemona</Person>. <Person>Albani</Person> 
married <Person>Ernest</Person> Gye, the lessee of Covent 
Garden, in 1878. In her singing, she com- 
bined high technical skill with profound 
feeling. She was equally successful on the 
operatic stage and in oratorio. In apprecia- 
tion of her services to British art, she was 
made a <Person>Dame</Person> of the British Empire (1925). 
She published her memoirs, <Person>Emma Albani</Person>: 
Forty Years of Song (London, 1911). 

<Person>Albani</Person>, Mattia (real name <Person>Mathias Al-</Person> 
ban), violin maker; b. <Person>S. Niccolo</Person> di Kaltern 
(Alto Adige) March, 1621 (baptized March 



28); <Event>d. Bolzano, Feb. 7, 1712</Event>. Pupil of 
<Person>Jakob Stainer</Person>. Violins of his are extant dat- 
ing from as early as the end of 1644. His 
best examples date from 1680 onward. Ow- 
ing to the great vogue his violins enjoyed, 
many <Person>Albani</Person> forgeries are in existence. A 
son, <Person>Giuseppe</Person>, his pupil, worked from 1680 
to 1722 at Bolzano, and another son, 
<Person>Michele</Person> (1677-1730) at Graz. Other violin 
makers named <Person>Albani</Person>, or at least using the 
name on their instruments (perhaps for its 
commercial value) are the following, none 
appearing to have been connected with the 
family of the original Mattia: Mattia 
(Rome, c. 1650-1715); <Person>Nicola</Person> (worked at 
Mantua, c. 1763); <Person>Filippo</Person> (active c. 1773); 
<Person>Francesco</Person> (active at Graz, c. 1724); <Person>Michele</Person> 
(at Palermo, 18th cent.); and <Person>Paolo</Person> (at 
Palermo and Cremona, 1630-70). 

<Person>Albeniz</Person>, <Person>Isaac</Person>, eminent Spanish com- 
poser; <Event>b. Camprodon, May 29, 1860</Event>; <Event>d. 
Cambo-Bains (Pyrenees), May 18, 1909</Event>. He 
exhibited precocious musical ability. When 
he was six, his mother took him to Paris, 
where he had a few private lessons with 
Marmontel. Upon his return to Spain, he 
gave concerts with his sister <Person>Clementine</Person>, 
also a child prodigy. In 1868 the family 
moved to Madrid, and <Person>Albeniz</Person> entered the 
Conservatory there. Possessed by a spirit of 
adventure, he ran away from home at the 
age of 13, and traveled in Spain, giving 
concerts. He then stowed away on a ship 
for Puerto Rico; from there he went to 
Cuba and to the U.S., supporting himself 
by playing concerts in private and in public. 
He returned to Spain in June, 1875, and 
was befriended in Madrid by Count Guil- 
lermo Morphy, who enabled him to under- 
take serious study, first at the Brussels Cons, 
with Brassin (piano) and Dupont and 
Gevaert (composition) ; and then at the 
Leipzig Cons, with Jadassohn and <Person>Reinecke</Person>. 
He went to Budapest in 1878 to meet <Person>Liszt</Person>, 
but it is doubtful that he actually became 
<Person>Liszt</Person> s pupil. <Person>Albeniz</Person> married <Person>Rosita Jor-</Person> 
dana in 1883; their daughter, <Person>Laura Albeniz</Person>, 
became a well known painter. In 1893 he 
settled in Paris; he also gave frequent piano 
recitals in Spain, and visited London. His 
early works were for the theater; he wrote 
several operas: The Magic <Person>Opal</Person> (London, 
Jan 19, 1893); <Person>Enrico Clifford</Person> (Barcelona, 
May 8, 1895); San Antonio de la Florida 
(Madrid, Oct. 26, 1894; also staged in 
Brussels, Jan. 3, 1905 under the title Er- 
mitage fleuri): <Person>Pepita JimSnez</Person> (Barcelona, 
Jan. 5, 1896). He undertook the composi- 
tion of an operatic trilogy King <Person>Arthur</Person>, of 
which only the first part, <Person>Merlin</Person>, was com- 
pleted. In the meantime he met <Person>Felipe</Person>

<Person>ALBENIZ</Person>   d  <Person>ALBERT</Person> 



Pedrell, and was greatly influenced by 
Pedrell s passionate championship of national 
Spanish music. <Person>Albeniz</Person> s first nationalistically 
inspired composition was the rhapsody Catal- 
onia for piano and orch. (1899). In 1906-09 
he wrote his most remarkable national work 
Iberia, a set of 12 piano pieces: Evocacidn, 
El Puerto, Fete-Dieu a Seville, Rondena, <Person><Person>Al</Person>-</Person> 
meria, Triana, El Albaicin, El Polo, Lava- 
pies, Malaga, Jerez, Eritana. In this suite, 
which is a brilliant example of virtuoso writ- 
ing for the instrument, <Person>Albeniz</Person> applied the 
impressionistic technique as developed by De- 
bussy. He left unfinished two other piano 
works, Azulejos (completed by Granados) 
and Navarra (completed by <Person>D. de Severac</Person>; 
orchestrated by Fernandez Arbos). Arbos 
also made effective orchestral transcriptions 
of Evocacidn, Triana, and Fete-Dieu a 
Seville (also orchestrated by Stokowski). 
Among <Person>Albeniz</Person> s smaller piano pieces, the 
Seguidillas, Cordova, and the Tango in <Person>D</Person> 
have attained wide popularity. Bibl. : <Person>J. de

music. At the age of 12 he entered the 
National Training School in London, where 
he studied piano with Pauer and theory 
with <Person>Stainer</Person>, Prout and <Person>Sir Arthur Sullivan</Person>. 
He made extraordinary progress both as 
pianist and composer, and after several ap- 
pearances at the Popular Concerts, was the 
soloist in <Person>Schumann</Person> s concerto at the <Person>Crystal 
Palace</Person>, London (Feb. 5, 1881). On Oct. 24, 
1881, when only 17, he played his own 
piano concerto at one of <Person>Hans Richter</Person> s 
concerts, arousing great enthusiasm; the 
press compared him to <Person>Mozart</Person> and Mendels- 
sohn. He received a Mendelssohn fellow- 
ship, and went to Vienna; later he studied 
with <Person>Liszt</Person>, who was greatly impressed by his 
technique and often referred to him as  the 
young Tausig.  In 1895, d <Person>Albert</Person> was ap- 
pointed conductor at Weimar; in 1907, be- 
came director of the High School for Music 
in Berlin. In the wake of his success, he 
repudiated his English birth, adopting <Person>Ger</Person>- 
man citizenship, and made repeated state- 
ments derogatory to English culture and 
even to his former English teachers. He was 
vocal in his enmity to England during the 
first World War, which led in turn to an 
understandable repugnance among British 
musicians to accept his music. <Person>D</Person> <Person>Albert</Person> com- 
posed industriously. He published two piano 
concertos (in <Person>B</Person> minor and E) ; a cello con- 
certo in <Person>C</Person>; 2 overtures (Hyperion and Es- 
ther); a symphony in F; an orchestral suite 
in 5 movements (1924); a piano sonata, a 
piano suite in 5 movements; 2 string quar- 
tets; Der Mensch und das <Person>Leben</Person> for 6-part 
chorus and orch. (op. 14) ; 4 piano pieces, 
op. 16 (Waltz, Scherzo, Intermezzo, <Person>Bal</Person>- 
lade), minor piano pieces and songs. 
However, his main interest was in the field 
of opera. Of his 20 operas, the most success- 
ful were: Tie f land, first staged at the 
German opera in Prague (Nov. 15, 1903), 
and Die toten Augen (Dresden, March 5, 
1916). The list of his other operas includes: 
Der Rubin (Karlsruhe, Oct. 12, 1893);

ning, Eugene d <Person>Albert</Person> did not justify his 
early promise, and his operas and other 
works are rarely revived. His musical idiom 
oscillates between the Italian melodic style 
and German contrapuntal writing, and fails 
to achieve originality. Eugene d <Person>Albert</Person> s per- 
sonal life was a stormy one. He was married 
six times; his first wife was <Person>Teresa Carreno</Person> 
(1892-95); his second was the singer, 
<Person>Hermine Finck</Person>.   Cf. <Person>W. Raupp</Person>, Eugen

sal (Leipzig, 1930). 

<Person>Albert</Person>, Karel, Belgian composer; <Event>b. Ant-

theater company (1926-31) ; later was active 
as music critic. He has written a ballet The 
Magic Lantern (1943); a number of scores 
of incidental music; 4 symphonies; several 
symph. poems and smaller works.

<Event>b. Rosenau, Coburg, Aug. 26, 1819</Event>; <Event>d. 
Windsor, Dec. 14, 1861</Event>. He married <Person>Queen 
Victoria</Person> on Feb. 10, 1840; lent energetic 
support to musical activities in England, 
sponsoring orchestras and choral societies. 
He studied organ and theory, and acquired 
an estimable technique of composition; 
wrote Invocazione alia armonia for chorus 
and orch. His songs were published in 1881 
under the title The Collected Compositions 
of his Royal Highness the <Person>Prince Consort</Person>. 
They reveal a romantic musical temper, 
influenced by Mendelssohn. 

<Person>Albert</Person>!, Domenico, Venetian composer; 
<Event>b. Venice, 1710</Event>; d. Formio, or Rome, c. 
1740. He studied with Lotti, and won con- 
siderable renown as singer and harpsichord 
player; wrote 3 operas, Endimione, <Person>Galatea</Person>, 
and Olimpiade. In 1737 he was a member 
of the Venetian Embassy in Rome, and 
made several appearances there as singer 
and player. His fame in music history rests 
on his reputed invention of the arpeggio 
style of keyboard accompaniment, which be- 
came known as the  Alberti Bass . His set 
of 8 sonatas, published by <Person>Walsh</Person> in London, 
gives many illustrations of this device. 

Albertsen, <Person>Per Hjort</Person>, Norwegian com- 
poser; <Event>b. Trondheim, July 27, 1919</Event>. He 
studied architecture, then turned to music; 
was church organist in Trondheim; later

an oratorio Bendik og Arolilja; choruses and 
piano pieces.

in 1722 he was in Munich where he pre- 
sented his festive opera / veri amici. It is,

contemporary, admired <Person>Albinoni</Person> s music; 
made arrangements of two fugues from <Person><Person>Al</Person>-</Person> 
binoni s trio-sonatas (<Person>Bach</Person> Gesellschaft, Nos.

wards, sang at La Scala in Rossini s Assedio 
di Corinto (Dec. 30, 1842). She then sang

appearing at the Italian opera with Tam- 
burini, Rubini and <Person>Mme. Viardot</Person>. After ap- 
pearances in Prague, Berlin and Hamburg, 
she appeared in the spring of 1847 in Rome 
and at Covent Garden where she became 
a rival of <Person>Jenny Lind</Person> with the public. So 
successful were her London appearances

ried Count Pepoli (<Event>d. Oct. 10, 1867</Event>); on 
Jan. 22, 1877 she married <Person>Charles Zieger</Person>, 
a French officer, and settled in France. Suf- 
fering from excessive obesity, she gradually 
retired from the stage, but continued to ap- 
pear occasionally in concert, singing while 
sitting in a large chair. Her vocal range 
was exceptional, from the contralto <Person>G</Person> to 
high soprano <Person>C</Person>, enabling her to sing soprano 
parts. She bequeathed a large sum of money 
to the City of Paris. In appreciation, the 
City Council, on Oct. 15, 1895, named a 
street in Passy after her. <Person>Arthur Pougin</Person> s

<Person>ALFANO</Person>   ALFIERI 



<Person>Alfano</Person>, <Person>Franco</Person>, eminent Italian composer; 
<Event>b. Posilippo (Naples), March 8, 1876</Event>; <Event>d. 
San Remo, Oct. 26, 1954</Event>. He studied com- 
position with <Person>Paolo Serrao</Person> in Naples, and 
with Jadassohn and <Person>Hans Sitt</Person> in Leipzig. 
From the beginning of his musical career, 
<Person>Alfano</Person> was interested in opera. His first 
stage work <Person>Miranda</Person> was produced in Leip- 
zig when he was barely 20; another opera, 
La Fonte di Enscir, followed (Breslau, Nov. 
8, 1898). In 1900 he went to Paris and 
became fascinated by light theater music. 
While in Paris he wrote a folk ballet Napoli 
which was staged at Folies-Bergeres (Jan. 
28, 1901), proving so successful that it ran 
for 160 successive performances. Returning 
to Italy, he began work on an opera after 
Tolstoy s novel Resurrection. It was pro- 
duced as Risurrezione, in Turin (Nov. 4, 
1904) with sensational acclaim; the Amer- 
ican premiere (Chicago, Dec. 31, 1925) 
was equally successful; there were also nu- 
merous performances in Germany and 
France. The opera was widely praised for 
its dramatic power and melodic richness in 
the best tradition of realistic Italian opera. 
<Person>Alfano</Person> continued to compose industriously 
for another half-century, but his later operas 
failed to equal the success of Risurrezione. 
They are: 77 Principe Zilah (Genoa, Feb. 
3, 1909) ; <Person>L</Person> ombra di <Person>Don Giovanni</Person> (La 
Scala, Milan, April 3, 1914) ; La Leggenda 
di Sakuntala (Bologna, Dec. 10, 1921) 
<Person>Madonna Imperia</Person>, lyric comedy (Turin 
May 5, 1927; Met. <Person>Opera, N. Y.</Person>, Feb. 8 
1928); <Person>L</Person> Ultimo Lord (Naples, April 19 
1930) ; Cyrano de Bergerac (Rome, Jan. 22 
1936) ; II Dottor <Person>Antonio</Person> (Rome, April 30 
1949). <Person>Alfano</Person> also wrote 3 symphonies 
(1909; 1932; 1934); 3 string quartets, a 
violin sonata, a cello sonata, and a ballet 
Vesuvius (1938; a symphonic poem was 
drawn from it in 1946). One of <Person>Alfano</Person> s 
signal achievements was that he completed 
Puccini s last opera, Turandot, adding the 
last scene. His Hymn to Bolivar, for chorus 
and orch., written for the centennial of 
Bolivar s death, was performed in Caracas, 
Venezuela, on Dec. 22, 1930. He was also 
active in the field of musical education; 
was successively director of the  Liceo mu- 
sicale  in Bologna (1919-23); of the Turin 
Cons. (1923-39); superintendent of the 
Teatro Massimo in Palermo (1940-42), and 
from 1947, director of the Rossini Cons, in 
Pesaro.   Bibl.: <Person>G. M. Gatti</Person>, <Person>Franco Alfano</Person>

Alfarabi, or Alpharabius, properly <Person>Al</Person> 
<Person>Farabi</Person> (abbr. <Person>Farabi</Person>) so named from his 
birthplace Farab (now transoxine Othrax), 
Arabian music theorist; b. c. 870; d. Damas- 
cus, c. 950. Of Turkish descent, he became 
renowned through his writings on philoso- 
phy, political science and the arts. He was 
a Greek scholar and attempted unsuccess- 
fully to introduce the Greek musical system 
into his country. His principal work is Kitab 
al-musiqi al-kabir ( Greater Book about 
Music ) dealing with acoustics, intervals, 
scales, instruments and rhythm. The 2nd 
volume of this work was lost. Excepts from 
this book are contained in Kosegarten s Alii 
Ispahanis Liber Cantilenarum <Person>Magnus</Person> 
(1840) and in <Person>J. Land</Person> s Recherches sur 
I histoire de la gamme arabe (Leyden, 1884).

ALkAN   <Person>ALLEN</Person> 



wrote 3 operas: Mitridate (1738), <Person>Ifigenia</Person> 
(1739), Semiramide (1740); a divertimento 
Apollo tra le Muse in Parnasso (1737), and 
a Stabat Mater (1749). 

Alkan (ahl-kahn) (real name Morhange); 
<Person>Charles-Henri Valentin</Person>, French pianist and 
composer of Jewish extraction; <Event>b. Paris, 
Nov. 30, 1813</Event>; <Event>d. there, March 29, 1888</Event>. 
His three brothers were also musicians; his 
father was the founder of a school for 
Jewish children. Alkan s talent was pre- 
cocious; he was accepted at the Paris Cons, 
at the age of six and studied piano with 
Zimmermann. In 1833 he visited London, 
then returned to Paris, where his main acti- 
vities were playing concerts in the fashion- 
able salons and teaching piano. He entered 
the brilliant circle of musicians and littera- 
teurs, among whom were Chopin, <Person>George 
Sand</Person>, <Person>Hugo</Person> and <Person>Liszt</Person>. He died as a result 
of injuries sustained when a heavy bookcase 
fell on him as he tried to reach for a book. 
Like Chopin, Alkan wrote almost exclusively 
for piano; the list of his works includes 76 
opus numbers, in addition to many pieces 
not numbered by opus. His pieces are pro- 
grammatic, bearing such titles as Desk; a 
set of variations, Les Omnibus; <Person>Le</Person> vent (op. 
15) ; <Person>Le</Person> Tambour bat aux Champs (op. 50) ; 
he was the first composer to write a piece de- 
scriptive of the railroad {<Person>Le</Person> Chemin de fer, 
op. 27). His 2 sets of etudes, in all major and 
minor keys (op. 35 and 39), of transcendent 
difficulty, present great interest as examples 
of modern piano technique. Other works 
are 3 Etudes de bravoure (op. 16) ; <Person>Le</Person> 
preux, etude de concert (op. 17); 3 pieces 
poetiques (op. 18); Bourree d Auvergne (op. 
29); a sonata (op. 33, subtitled Les quatre 
ages); Les mois (op. 8, 74), comprising 12 
pieces, etc. He also wrote 2 piano con- 
certos, a piano trio, a cello sonata and vocal 
music. <Person>Cesar Franck</Person> arranged several of 
his pieces for organ. For a long time Alkan s 
music was completely forgotten, but his sig- 
nificance as an inventive composer became 
more evident in the 20th century. Chapters 
dealing with Alkan are found in Sorabji s 
book Around Music (London, 1932), and in 
<Person>Bernard van Dieren</Person> s Down Among the 
Dead Men (London, 1935).

then studied with <Person>Giovanni Maria Nanino</Person> 
(1600-07). He entered the Papal Chapel in 
1629, after serving for some years as choris- 
ter and composer for the cathedral at Fermo. 
He is chiefly known as the composer of the 
celebrated Miserere in 9 parts (<Person>i</Person>.e., for two 
choirs singing 4 and 5 parts respectively), 
regularly sung during Holy Week at the 
Sistine Chapel, and surreptitiously written 
out by <Person>Mozart</Person> after hearing it twice, though 
its publication was forbidden on pain of 
excommunication; since then it has been 
frequently published. Many other works by 
<Person>Allegri</Person> are preserved in MS.; 2 books of 
Concertini and 2 of Mottetti have been 
printed, also a 4-part sonata for strings 
which might be regarded as the prototype 
of the string quartet. See <Person>A. Cametti</Person>, La

Alypios, Greek musical theorist, who 
flourished in the middle of the 4th century. 
His  Introduction to Music  is the chief 
source of specific information regarding an- 
cient Greek notation; it contains a summary 
of Greek scales in all their transpositions, 
both for voices and instruments. This treatise 
was published by Meursius (Leyden, 1616); 
by Meibom in his Antiquae musicae auctores 
septem (Amsterdam, 1652); and reprinted 
by <Person>F. Bellermann</Person> in Die Tonleitern und 
Musiknoten der Griechen (Berlin, 1847). 
A new critical edition is found in <Person>Jan</Person> s 
Musici scriptores graeci (1895). A graphic

Amadei, <Person>Filippo</Person>, Italian opera composer; 
<Event>b. Reggio, 1683</Event>; place and date of death

was the real author of the first act of the 
opera Muzio Scevola, for which Bononcini 
wrote the second act, and Handel the third, 
and which was produced at the Royal 
Academy of Music in London, April 15, 
1721. Amadei s name was erroneously con- 
verted into <Person>Filippo Mattei</Person> by Mattheson in 
his Critica musica and the mistake was car- 
ried into reference works and Handel s 
biographies. 

<Person>Amalia</Person>, the name of three German prin- 
cesses who were musicians. See <Person>Anna Amalia</Person> 
(Princess of Prussia), <Person>Anna Amalia</Person> (Duch-

<Person>Andre</Person>, <Person>Johann</Person>, German composer, pub- 
lisher, and father of a musical family; <Event>b. 



Offenbach, March 28, 1741</Event>; <Event>d. there, June 
18, 1799</Event>. He founded (Sept. 1, 1774) at 
Offenbach a music publishing house under 
his name and had publ. 1,200 compositions 
by the time of his death. For seven years 
(1777-84) he was Kapellmeister at Dobble- 
lin s Theater in Berlin. He was a prolific 
composer, author of 19 Singspiele and 14 
miscellaneous scores for the stage, among 
them Der Topfer (Hanau, Jan. 22, 1773) 
and Der Liebhaber als Automat (Berlin, 
Sept. 11, 1782). Bretzner wrote the libretto 
of Die Entfiihrung aus dem Serail, or Bel- 
mont und <Person>Constanze</Person> for him; the opera was 
produced in Berlin, May 25, 1781. The 
same text was used the following year by 
<Person>Mozart</Person> for his celebrated work, which 
elicited Bretzner s haughty protest against 
 a certain man named <Person>Mozart</Person>  for the un- 
authorized use of his libretto. Among 
<Person>Andre</Person> s songs, the Rheinweinlied ( Bekranzt 
mit Laub ) was widely performed. <Person>Andre</Person> is 
credited with being the composer of the first 
 durchkomponierte Ballade,  Die Weiber von 
Weinsberg (1783). 

<Person>Andre</Person>, (<Person>Johann</Person>) <Person>Anton</Person>, third son of 
<Person>Johann Andre</Person>; <Event>b. Offenbach, Oct. 6, 1775</Event>; 
<Event>d. there April 6, 1842</Event>. A precocious talent, 
he studied with Vollweiler in Mannheim 
(1793-96); was a fine pianist, violinist and 
composer before entering the Univ. of <Person>Jena</Person>; 
after completing his studies he made exten- 
sive travels, and on his father s death took 
charge of the business, adding particular 
lustre to its good name by the purchase 
( 1 800 ) of <Person>Mozart</Person> s entire musical remains. 
He publ. <Person>Mozart</Person> s autograph thematic cat- 
alogue, and supplemented it by a list of the 
works so acquired. By accepting the appli- 
cation of the lithographic process to music- 
engraving (1779), he took another long 
stride towards placing his firm in the front 
rank. He was also a composer (2 operas, 
symphonies, songs, etc. ) , a successful teacher, 
and a noteworthy theorist. He wrote 2 vols, 
on harmony, counterpoint, canon and fugue, 
(1832-43; new revised ed. 1875); and An- 
leitung zum Violinspiele.   His sons were: 
(1) <Person>Carl August</Person>, <Event>b. Offenbach, June 15, 
1806</Event>; <Event>d. Frankfurt, Feb. 15, 1887</Event>; head

tions, and arranger of <Person>Mozart</Person> s works for
